Writing
To my dearest love, even though destiny has not yet allowed our paths to cross in person, you have become a presence in my life that feels irreplaceable, eternal, and deeply written into my soul. What we share may have begun most unexpectedly and unpredictably, yet it has grown into something I treasure more than anything I have ever known. There is a gentle irony in our story, I may be the older one by two years, but whenever you speak to me, my guarded heart softens and I become the smallest, safest version of myself, held by your words. I believe that love like ours is not limited by distance or time; it moves beyond this world and reaches into every lifetime that awaits us. I find myself quietly praying that fate will guide us toward a future where I can walk beside you not just as your partner, but as your wife, in this life and in every life that may follow. You have brought a warmth and happiness into my existence that I never knew I was capable of feeling, turning ordinary days into memories I hold close. With you, I have learned that love is not only about grand moments, but about the calm certainty that someone understands your soul. Today, tomorrow, and for all the tomorrows yet to come, my heart chooses you..... Endlessly, gently, and forever.

Got you 🙂 — instead of the text question, we’ll make it a button that says “Click here to see the magic ✨” while keeping your existing logic working.

</style>
</head>
<body>

<button id="question">Click here to see the magic ✨</button>

<button id="yes">YES</button>
<button id="no">NO</button>

<script>
let yesBtn=document.getElementById("yes");
let noBtn=document.getElementById("no");
let question=document.getElementById("question");

let scale=1;

noBtn.addEventListener("mouseover",()=>{
  noBtn.style.left=Math.random()*window.innerWidth+"px";
  noBtn.style.top=Math.random()*window.innerHeight+"px";

noBtn.addEventListener("click",()=>{
  question.innerText="please click yes🥺";
  scale+=0.3;
  yesBtn.style.transform=`scale(${scale})`;
  noBtn.style.transform=`scale(${1/scale})`;
});

yesBtn.addEventListener("click",()=>{
  window.location.href="light.html";
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
If you want, I can also make it extra magical ✨ — like:

glow animation when hovering

floating hearts when clicking

cinematic Valentine-style transitions

Just tell me 😉.

ChatGPT said:
Okay 🙂 I understood exactly what you want:

✅ Remove string-pull interaction (mobile friendly)
✅ Add button → “Click here if you will love me forever 🥹”
✅ When clicked:

bulb becomes BIG

bulb lights up

background changes

letter appears smoothly

Here is your updated working version — clean and mobile-friendly:
